Education is an essential part of life and it covers a very broad area of knowledge.
    We can also call education as a process of gaining knowledge. The only difference between 
    apes and humans was, they were not educated and we are educated and well mannered.

Education not only develops our academic performance but is also helpful in other curricular 
activities. We learn to read, write, speak, learn various skills, practice other activities; 
all are various types of education.</article>
